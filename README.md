## Indicator Buffers
- **ExtBuffer1**: Buffer for storing the peaks detected by the indicator.
- **ExtBuffer2**: Buffer for storing the troughs detected by the indicator.

## Indicator Initialization
The `OnInit()` function is called during the indicator initialization process. It sets up the indicator buffers and defines the indicator name.

## Indicator Calculation
The `OnCalculate()` function is called for each new tick or bar of data. It calculates the RSI, detects peaks and troughs in the RSI, and identifies divergences between peaks and troughs. Each detected divergence is represented by a trend line drawn on the chart.
